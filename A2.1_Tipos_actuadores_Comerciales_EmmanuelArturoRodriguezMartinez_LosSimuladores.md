 - **Introduction**  
 Stepper motors are very useful motors since they allow to control very precisely the movement of the motor and the number of degrees that it moves. making it of great importance in jobs that require greater precision, on this occasion we will talk about its simplest model, the [unipolar stepper motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo8T6ssCR8g) that stands out for maintaining that high precision of the stepper motors but also being easier to use that other motors of this type
 
- **Development**
    - **Definition**.
    The [unipolar stepper motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fawhMWtzTl4) is a stepper type motor, which means that when a voltage is applied to it, this one moves a certain number of angles transforming electrical impulses into controlled rotational movements.  
    This specific type of motor is the unipolar one that is easier to control and only allows current to pass in one direction

    - **Explain the principle of operation**
    
        The unipolar stepper motor operates with one winding with a center tap per phase. Each section of the winding is switched on for each direction of the magnetic field. Each winding is made relatvely simple with the commutation circuit, this is donde since the arrangement has magnetic pole wich can be reversed without switching the direction of the current.

    There are three possible [sequences](http://electronica.ugr.es/~amroldan/asignaturas/curso01-02/diseno/practicas/curso0102/RYS/tutoriales/tutorial%20sobre%20motores%20paso%20a%20paso.htm) for this type of engines, which are detailed below. All sequences start again by step 1 after reaching the final step (4 or 8). To reverse the direction of rotation, simply run the sequences in reverse mode.

    - Normal Sequence: This is the most used sequence and the one generally recommended by the manufacturer. With this sequence the engine advances one step at a time and because there are always at least two coils activated, you get a high pitch and hold torque.

    - Wave drive sequence: In this sequence only one coil is activated at a time. In some engines this provides smoother operation. The counterpart is that since only one coil is activated, the torque of step and retention is less.
    <img src="../img/A2_1_wave.png">


    - Half-step sequence: In this sequence the coils are activated in such a way to provide a movement equal to half of the actual step. For this, 2 coils are activated first and then only 1 and so on. As we see in the table the entire sequence consists of 8 moves instead of 4.

        They are mainly used in applications that require precise travel control, positioning devices, because it is easy to make the appropriate device and software using a computer and a controller. They are also widely used in biomedical appliances, computer disk drives, printers, scanners, smart lighting, to control camera lenses, the position of control elements in combustion engines, robotics, 3D printers and scanners, XY plotters, CNC machines. and other devices.

   **David:** The unipolar stepper motor is a great stepper motor to use when you are learning to use them for its great ease of use, mantaining almos all the advantages of the stepper motors with really only a few setbacks making it a grat options for begginers and experts alike

   **Axel:** To conclude I can say that these types of engines help us in circumstances where we occupy the engine moving slowly, or occupy a slow motion of the engine

   **Emmanuel** In conclusion, unipolar stepper motors work through magnets which make the motor rotate taking steps, this makes it possible to carry out jobs that need a lot of precision like that of a 3D printer.
   
   **Oscar Rojas** The unipolar stepper is a great solution for small project it is easy to use, cheap and you can use it as a bipolar stepper.
